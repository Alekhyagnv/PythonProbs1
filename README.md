S1P11-Birthday Challenge

Birthday Challenge
 
Louis was celebrating his 10th Birthday and his parents wished to make his birthday more special by throwing a surprise bash, inviting all their friends, relatives and neighbors. The little mathematics geek Louis has another surprise waiting for him when he had to cut his favorite Choco vanilla cake. The cake is a rectangular cake and it consists of m×n (1≤m, n≤1000) squares. His friends now called him out for a challenge.
 
The challenge is that, Louis has to break the cake up into 1×1 pieces (individual squares) and find what is the minimum number of times that he breaks the choco vanilla cake, or pieces thereof, in order to achieve this?
 
Note that he cannot stack pieces of the cake and break them, because the choco vanilla cake is thick. As an example, a 2×2 cake requires 3 breaks. First he can break it in half, then break each of the halves in half. He cannot break it in half, stack the two 1×2 pieces, and then use only one more break to achieve his goal.
 
Input Format:
First line of the input consists of an integer, the dimensions m of the choco vanilla cake.
Second line of the input consists of an integer, the dimensions n of the choco vanilla cake.

Output Format:
Output the minimum number of times that he breaks the choco vanilla cake

Minimum and Maximum
 
The ExConFair is the region's largest trade fair on Construction Equipments & Technology. The Event organizers hired college students as volunteers to work at the fair as the event is targeted to be attended by approx. 30 million visitors.
 
At the Office in the fair, there are two guards who count how many times a volunteer enters into the fair ground. Though the duty of a guard is 24 hour in a day, but sometimes they fall asleep during their duty and could not track the entry of volunteers in the fair ground. But one better thing is that they never fall asleep at the same time. At least one of them remains awake and counts who enters into the office. Now the Event Head wants to calculate how many times a volunteer has entered into the fair ground. He asked to the guard and they give him two integers A and B, count of first guard and second guard respectively.
Help the Event Head to count the minimum and maximum number of times a volunteer could have entered into the fair ground.

"Think Academy" has arranged for a competitive test for engineering students from rural villages. Those successful students of the test will be awarded the scholarship for their GRE/TOEFL preparations at Think Academy. Francis, the co-coordinator and founder of the academy has N different problemsets and there are N students who are appearing for the test. Each problemset contains zero or more problems. He will give each student exactly one problemset. But the problemsets might contain different number of problems in each one, which looks unfair.

Since Francis is a fair tutor, he decided to move some problems from problemset to another problemset (he can do this multiple times), until all problemsets contain the same number of problems.

Sometimes it's impossible to do so, and he might need to delete some problems completely before moving any problem, then he will start moving the problems. He needs your help to write a program to calculate the minimum number of problems to be deleted, and the minimum number of problems to be moved.

Input Format:
First line of the input contains one integer N (1 <= N <= 100) representing the number of problemsets and the number of trainees.
Second line of the input contains N non-negative integers separated by a single space, representing the number of problems in each problemset. Each problemset will contain at most 100 problems.
