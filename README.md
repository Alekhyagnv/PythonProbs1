S1P11-Birthday Challenge

Birthday Challenge
 
Louis was celebrating his 10th Birthday and his parents wished to make his birthday more special by throwing a surprise bash, inviting all their friends, relatives and neighbors. The little mathematics geek Louis has another surprise waiting for him when he had to cut his favorite Choco vanilla cake. The cake is a rectangular cake and it consists of m×n (1≤m, n≤1000) squares. His friends now called him out for a challenge.
 
The challenge is that, Louis has to break the cake up into 1×1 pieces (individual squares) and find what is the minimum number of times that he breaks the choco vanilla cake, or pieces thereof, in order to achieve this?
 
Note that he cannot stack pieces of the cake and break them, because the choco vanilla cake is thick. As an example, a 2×2 cake requires 3 breaks. First he can break it in half, then break each of the halves in half. He cannot break it in half, stack the two 1×2 pieces, and then use only one more break to achieve his goal.
 
Input Format:
First line of the input consists of an integer, the dimensions m of the choco vanilla cake.
Second line of the input consists of an integer, the dimensions n of the choco vanilla cake.

Output Format:
Output the minimum number of times that he breaks the choco vanilla cake

 Lucky Gifts
 
"Planet Kids Entertainment Fair" is back to delight kids and parents. The Fair will have non-stop entertainment with an extravaganza of games, exciting rides, sports, art & crafts, role-plays, inspiring competitions, prizes & gifts, and yummy food.
 
Few lucky attendees at the Fair will be given a pack of candies as a lucky gift and the show coordinator has assigned you the task for choosing the number of attendees who will receive the pack of candies. There are 'N' candies available and you need to decide how many candies to place in each pack. Each pack must contain the same number of candies. You should choose an integer A between 1 and N, inclusive, and place exactly A candies into each pack. You should make as many packs as possible but since you enjoy eating candies very much, you eat the remaining candies. 
 
Write a program that will calculate the pack size(A) so that you can eat as many candies as possible. If multiple pack size will result in the same number of leftover candies, then print the largest pack size.
 
Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains an integer N.
 
Output Format:
Output a single line that gives the pack size that will maximize the number of leftover candies.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input 1:
2

Sample Output 1:
2

Explanation:
There will be no leftover candies regardless of the size of the pack you choose. So you choose the largest possible pack size 2.

Sample Input 2:
5

Sample Output 2:
3

Explanation:
There will be 2 leftover candies, if you choose 3 as the pack size.
